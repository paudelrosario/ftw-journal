   - Copy `templates/entry.md` to `journal/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
   - Example: `journal/2025-09-13-day1.md`
2. **Write during/after class** (10–15 mins is fine).
3. **Commit small & often**:
   ```bash
   git add journal/*.md
   git commit -m "Add Day 1 notes"
   git push
````

4. **Present from your journal** in standups/demos.

## Learn Markdown

This journal uses [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) — a simple way to format text on GitHub.
Learning Markdown will make your notes cleaner and easier to read (headings, bullets, tables, code blocks, etc.).

Quick examples:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
- Bullet point
- **Bold** and *italic*
`inline code`
```

## Suggested file naming

```
journal/
  2025-09-13-day1.md
  2025-09-20-day2.md
  2025-09-27-day3.md
  2025-10-04-day4.md
```

## Data Engineering Mindset (keep visible)

* **Raw stays raw** → Clean → **Mart** (separate layers).
* **Reproducible**: scripts/configs over manual steps.
* **Document assumptions & decisions** (why, not just what).
* **Communicate clearly**: inputs, outputs, owners, SLAs.
* **Small changes**: atomic commits; test + verify.
* **Observe & log**: data quality, lineage, and failure points.

---

## Presenting with this journal

* Start with **context** (dataset, goal, constraints).
* Show **diagram** (even a quick sketch) of flow (Raw → Clean → Mart).
* Call out **trade-offs** (cost, freshness, complexity).
* End with **next steps** + **open questions**.
