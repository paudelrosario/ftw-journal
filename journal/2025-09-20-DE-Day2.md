# Journal ‚Äî 9-20-2025 ‚Äî Data Modeling

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- [ ] **Data pipelines typically move data from** *Raw ‚Üí Clean ‚Üí Sandbox ‚Üí Mart* **layers.**  
- [ ] **Raw layer stores original data** *as-is*.  
- [ ] **Clean layer applies transformations and cleaning for** *consistent, reliable data*.  
- [ ] **Sandbox layer is for experimenting with queries on** *the clean data*.  
- [ ] **Mart layer provides curated views or tables designed for** *final analysis and reporting*.  
- [ ] **Tables physically save data copies; views save the SQL query, dynamically showing results.**  
- [ ] **Data models use normalization forms:** *1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF/5NF* ‚Äî **increasing purity and reducing anomalies.**  
- [ ] **Working locally vs. remote involves deciding where tools** *(DLT, dbt, databases)* **run‚Äîon your machine or cloud/server.**



## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- **ENGINE MEMORY**: Data stored in memory, making access much faster  
- **DATA MAPPING**: Linking and organizing data between different structures or sources  


## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- Build **reusable, scalable data pipelines** that grow with your needs  

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- Deciding when to run tools locally versus remotely for resource efficiency.

## 5) Open questions (things I still don‚Äôt get)
- ‚ùì How do I create a clear and flexible **entity-relationship model**?  
- ‚ùì How to ensure my **ER diagrams adapt** as projects evolve?  
- ‚ùì What's the best approach to **document database schemas** and design choice

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
[ ] Practice simple to advanced SQL Queries (Enroll in Tutorials Dojo)
[ ] Practice creating ER diagrams
[ ] Learn to run dbt or DLT commands remotely and handle typical errors.


## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)

### Mini reflection (3‚Äì5 sentences)
Data is more than just rows and columns. It‚Äôs a **system and structure**. Thoughtful design helps build trustworthy data, making insights reliable and accessible for all team members.
