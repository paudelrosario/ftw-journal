# Journal — 9-27-2025 — Group Presentations

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- [ ] **How to ingest data using Python**  
- [ ] **How to use VS Code to transform SQL data into DBeaver**  
- [ ] **How to create fact and dimension tables**


## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- **Fact table** — A central table that stores measurable events (e.g., sales, orders).  
- **Dimension table** — A supporting table that stores descriptive attributes (e.g., customer, product).  
- **Schema** — A blueprint or structure that defines how data is organized in a database.  


## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- Build **reusable, scalable data pipelines** that grow with your needs  

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- 

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- ❓ When is it better to query in VS Code, and when is it better to query in DBeaver?
- ❓ When is a star schema better than a snowflake schema?

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- [ ] Learn simple to advanced SQL Queries.  
- [ ] Learn basic Python (Enroll in Tutorials Dojo).
- [ ] Use tracker for the group activities.


## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
-

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
Data is more than just rows and columns. It’s a **system and structure**. Thoughtful design helps build trustworthy data, making insights reliable and accessible.
