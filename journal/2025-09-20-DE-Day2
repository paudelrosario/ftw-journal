# Journal — 9-20-2025 — Data Modeling

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
Raw -> Clean (Cleaned Version) -> Sandbox (Query) -> Mart (views for connection with DataBase)

    Table saves the data - creates a new copy of data
    View - continuous query; saves the query



## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- ENGINE MEMORY - saves to memory
- DATA MAPPING - 


## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- 

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- 

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
-

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- [ ] 

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
-

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
Learning how to learn :)
    Data as a system. Data as a structure.
    Make sure that data is understandable and trustable.





### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
